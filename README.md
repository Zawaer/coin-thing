# Coin Thing

Coin Thing is a small 3D FPS game. You can shoot coins from your pipe and hit a target. This was my learning project, so that's why it's not that advanced. This repo contains the Godot project in `game/` and a Next.js wrapper in `website/` to host the exported game.

Play the live demo at https://coin-thing.vercel.app/

## Controls

- WASD - Move
- Space - Jump
- Shift - Sprint
- Left click - Single shoot (shoot one coin)
- Right click - Hold to rapid-fire (unlocked after hitting the target)
- Esc - Release mouse (if captured)

Run in Godot (recommended for development)
----------------------------------------
1. Open the Godot editor and load `game/project.godot`.
2. Press Play (or run the main scene) to run in the editor.
