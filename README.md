# Siege — FAQ

Last revised 2025-10-02 by @One For Freedom

Welcome to Siege — a focused 14-week ship-a-week program. This README summarizes the rules, prizes, and expectations.

## What is Siege?

Siege is a 14-week program where the challenge is to ship every week. Only hours shipped at the end of each week count. If you miss a week (no ship submitted), you are out of the Siege. If you make it to the end, you’re eligible for a Framework laptop (see prizes).

If you have questions, ask in `#siege-help`.

## Timeline

- Siege runs 14 weeks total: 4 preparation weeks (optional) + 10 main siege weeks.
- We are currently in the main weeks — you must start on time. If you start even one week late you’ll be too late for eligibility.

## Requirements

- Each siege week you must ship at least 10 hours to stay in Siege.
- During preparation weeks there are no minimums; shipping during prep weeks can earn stickers and other small rewards.

You can combine real hours and mercenaries (see below) to meet the weekly quota.

## AI usage

- AI help is allowed but limited:
  - Up to 30% AI usage is allowed.
  - Projects with >60% AI will not get voting bonuses.
  - Projects with >80% AI or with AI "slop" may be rejected.

Be transparent about AI use in your README when you ship.

## Double-dipping & fraud

- Submitting the same project to multiple YSWSs (double-dipping) is NOT allowed.
- Any fraud (including false claims about time or submissions) will get you immediately removed from Siege and may result in a Hackatime ban.

If a ban was issued in error, the situation will be reviewed — but fraudulent activity has strict consequences.

## Mercenaries (hour skips)

- Mercenaries are hour-skips you buy with coins. Purchases are final.
- Calculation example: If you do 10 hours and have 3 mercenaries, that counts as 13 hours.
- You can use a maximum of 10 mercenaries per week. They do not carry over.

## Coins, prizes, and upgrades

- During siege weeks you get 5 base coins for completing the first 10 hours, then 1 coin per extra hour.
- Coins can have up to a 5x multiplier based on votes.
- Reviewers can award up to a 3x bonus for commit rates.

Prizes:

- The grand prize for completing all 10 siege weeks is a Framework laptop (FW-12 base spec: 8GB RAM, 500GB SSD, PSU) with upgrade options purchasable with coins.
- If Framework does not ship to your country, you will receive a grant to buy your own laptop.
- Additional weekly prizes and unique rewards will be announced during the Siege.

## Projects and ships

Time counts from 1st September. Work done before that date is ineligible (except as background) — only hours after Sep 1 count.

Rules for ships:

- Allowed:
  - New projects created during Siege.
  - Continuing an existing Siege project (hours must be Siege-eligible and not double-dipped).
- Not allowed:
  - Continuing a non-Siege project that was previously submitted to another YSWS.
  - Closed-source projects (ships must be open-source for review).

Each shipped project must include:

1. A repository with source code
2. A demo (deployed or downloadable)
3. A representative image (used for voting)

README guidance for your repo (what to include):

- An image of the project (screenshot, cover image).
- A short description of the project and inspiration.
- How to try it (demo URL or quick run instructions).
- Technologies used (high-level list is fine).

## Demo guidance

- Websites: deploy to GitHub Pages / Vercel / Netlify so judges can visit a URL. Do not ask judges to build locally.
- Games: provide a build on itch.io or a web-export. Bonus points for a playable web build.
- Packages / CLIs: publish to the appropriate package index (npm, PyPI, crates.io, etc.)

## Voting & schedule

- Submit one project per week by Sunday 23:59 EST to be included in voting.
- Voting typically happens the following week (Mon–Wed) with a review round on Thursday and payouts/prizes on Friday.
- Participating in voting may grant you extra coffers.

## Prep weeks vs Siege weeks

- Prep weeks: no minimum, ship 5+ hours per prep week for stickers.
- Siege weeks: mandatory 10 hours/ week to remain eligible. You cannot join after the first siege week.

## Shipping regions and Framework availability

Check Framework shipping availability here:

If Framework doesn't ship to your country, you will receive a grant instead.

## Failure & re-entry

- If you fail Siege (miss a week), you'll have to wait for the next run — there are no makeups.
- You can still participate in the community, ship projects, vote, and purchase items from the shop.
